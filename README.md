Network Automation Portfolio  
This repo documents my learning path and projects for network engineering and automation. It contains modular labs, automation scripts, Ansible playbooks, topology files, packet captures, and a Flask-based dashboard. Each folder includes a clear README, expected outputs, and a short demo (GIF or video) so reviewers can quickly validate functionality.
